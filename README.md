CSE445 (Machine Learning) Research Project
<br>
This was my CSE445 course's project. Worked on machine learning models to accurately predict profitable entries and exits for stocks listed under Dhaka Stock Exchange using multiple indicators and training them using three different ML models - Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi Layered Perceptron (MLP). Research results show that RF outperforms them all.
We obtained accuracy as high as 82% on the random forest model.
